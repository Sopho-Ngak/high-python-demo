Assignment: Student Grade Management System
Requirements:

Create a program that manages student grades. The program should include the following functionalities:

    Student Class:
        Create a Student class with attributes name and grades.
        Implement methods to:
            Initialize a student with a name.
            Add a grade to the student's record.
            Calculate and return the average grade of the student.

    Grade Management Module:
        Create a Python module named grade_management.py.
        Implement a function add_grade(student_name, grade) that adds a grade to a student's record.
        Implement a function calculate_average(student_name) that calculates the average grade of a student.

    Error Handling:
        Implement error handling using try-except blocks to handle the following scenarios:
            If a student's name is not found when adding or calculating grades, raise a StudentNotFoundError.
            If an invalid grade (not a number between 0 and 100) is provided, raise a InvalidGradeError.

    Inheritance:
        Create a subclass HonorsStudent that inherits from the Student class.
        Override the calculate_average method to include a bonus of 5% to the average grade.

Instructions:

    Start by defining the Student class with its attributes and methods.
    Create the grade_management.py module with functions to add grades and calculate average grades.
    Implement error handling using try-except blocks in the functions of the module.
    Create the HonorsStudent subclass and override the necessary method.
    Write a main program (can be a separate Python script) to test the functionalities of the system.

project structure:
    student_grade_management/
    ├── grade_management.py
    ├── student.py
    └── main.py

student.py file contains the Student class and the HonorsStudent subclass (inherits Student class).
grade_management.py file contains the add_grade and calculate_average functions, StudentNotFoundError (inherits Exception class), and InvalidGradeError.
e.g: 
class InvalidGradeError(Exception):
    pass
main.py file contains the main program to test the functionalities of the system.
